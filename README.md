Pull Request Club is a web application written in Perl using the [Catalyst
Framework](http://www.catalystframework.org/).
Users can sign up with their GitHub accounts, and do two things:
- Receive monthly assignments, and
- Let the system assign their repositories to other participants.

If you are looking for an open source project to work on, or if you are
looking for some help for your open source project, Pull Request Club might
be able to help. Give it a try at
[PullRequest.Club](https://pullrequest.club).
