  <h2>What is Pull Request Club?</h2>
  <p>You can sign up to PullRequest.Club (PRC) to receive random GitHub repos as your assignment each month. Your goal would be to fix something, and submit a pull request, hence the name.</p>
  <p>You can also sign up <i>your own GitHub repositories</i> to PullRequest.Club, so that we assign <i>your</i> repositories to people who want something to work on.</p>

  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>Pull Request Club is built to be a successor of <a href='http://cpan-prc.org/' target='_blank'>The CPAN Pull Request Challenge</a>. We are extremely grateful to Neil Bowers, who run CPAN-PRC for 4 years (January 2015 to December 2018).</p>

  <h2>Rules</h2>
  <p>We give out assignments on 1st day of each month. In order to be eligible for an assignment, you must satisfy all conditions below.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You have agreed to our latest terms of use and privacy policy.</li>
    <li>You have opted-in to receive assignment. Your status is "ACTIVE" in your settings.</li>
    <li>You don't have any open assignments that are neither completed nor cancelled. This means one of following is true:</li>
    <ul>
      <li>You have never received an assignment from us.</li>
      <li>You have completed the last assignment you received from us.</li>
      <li>You have cancelled the last assignment you received from us.</li>
    </ul>
  </ul>

  <p>Once you receive your monthly assignment on 1st day of month, you have following options:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><b>Complete:</b> You can complete your assignment by submitting a Pull Request to your assignment repository on GitHub. Note that your assignment status might take some time to update.</li>
    <li><b>Request a new one:</b> If you think you cannot work on this repository, but want to work on something else instead, you can do so until 5th of month. You can do this once per month.</li>
    <li><b>Cancel:</b> You can always cancel your assignment, and get a new one on 1st of next month.</li>
    <li><b>Wait:</b> If you have an open assignment on 1st of next month, we will not give you a new assignment assuming you are still working on it. It's ok! You can take your time. We will make sure to mark you assignment as "completed" when you are done.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>To receive assignees to your repositories, you must satisfy all conditions below.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>You have agreed to our latest terms of use and privacy policy.</li>
    <li>You have opted-in to receive assignees. Your status is "ACTIVE" in your settings.</li>
    <li>Repository you want assignees for is checked to receive assignees in "My Repos" page.</li>
    <li>Repository you want assignees for must have open issues. You can confirm issue count in "My Repos" page.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Unfortunately, we cannot guarantee all repositories you have selected will receive assignees each month. We also cannot guarantee that an assignee will actually submit a pull request.</p>
