<h2>Hi [% user_github_login -%]!</h2>

Thank you so much for your contributions to the Pull Request Club!<br>
<br>
I'm planning to print a t-shirt and gift it to the distinguished contributors and maintainers such as yourself. Please fill in the form below to let me know whether you are interested in receiving a t-shirt.<br>
<br>
This form currently doesn't ask for your address details, but asks for your current country (to estimate the shipping procedure). I'm also roughly asking for a t-shirt size to estimate how many of which size I will need to order.<br>
<br>
If you have filled this form before, you do not need to fill it again. Please do not share the form link publicly, as t-shirts will only be gifted to those who receive this email.<br>
<br>
Please go to this link: <a href="[% form_link -%]">[% form_link -%]</a><br>
