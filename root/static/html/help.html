  <h1>General Questions</h1>
  <br>


  <h4>What is a pull request?</h4>
  <p>Pull request is a way to contribute to open source projects. It contains a file showing changed lines. GitHub adds a discussion to pull requests. This is to let contributors and maintainers communicate. We recommend <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this article on GitHub</a> for more details.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>How do I submit a pull request?</h4>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/CPAN-PRC/resources/wiki/My-first-Pull-Request" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">This article</a> will walk you through your first pull request. <a href="https://github.com/CPAN-PRC/resources/wiki/Pull-Request-Ideas" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">This article</a> will give you some concrete pull request ideas.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>What is Pull Request Club?</h4>
  <p>Pull Request Club is an online application. If you are looking for open source projects to submit a pull request, it can find you one. If you have a project and looking for people who would submit pull requests, it can find you some.</p>
  <p>We built Pull Request Club to be a successor of <a href='http://cpan-prc.org/' rel="nofollow" target='_blank'>The CPAN Pull Request Challenge</a>. We are grateful to Neil Bowers, who run CPAN-PRC for 4 years (January 2015 to December 2018).</p>

  <h1>Assignments</h1>
  <br>


  <h4>What is an assignment?</h4>
  <p>An assignment is a GitHub repository assigned to a user. Users who receive an assignment should submit at least one pull request.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>How can I receive assignments?</h4>
  <p>After you sign up and agree to the Terms of Use, you need to make sure to check GET ASSIGNMENTS in <a href="/settings">settings</a>. If you have an open assignment you won't receive a new one.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>What is an open assignment?</h4>
  <p>It's an unfinished assignment that is not marked as DONE or SKIPPED yet. If you have an open assignment you won't receive a new one.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>When do I get assignments?</h4>
  <p>We send assignments at the top of each month. You can receive up to 12 assignments a year.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>How do I complete an assignment?</h4>
  <p>Submit at least one pull request to your assignment repository on GitHub. Then click DONE in <a href="/my-assignment">your assignment</a> page. You don't have to wait for maintainers to merge your pull request.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>How do I skip an assignment?</h4>
  <p>Click SKIP in <a href="/my-assignment">your assignment</a> page.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>I don't like my assignment, can I get a different one?</h4>
  <p>While that is not possible on site, we may be able to help. Contact us via <a href="mailto:kyzn@cpan.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">kyzn@cpan.org</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/PullRequestClub" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">@PullRequestClub</a>.

  <br>


  <h4>I need more time for my assignment.</h4>
  <p>That is OK! Your assignment will stay OPEN until you mark it as DONE or SKIPPED. Note that if you have an open assignment you won't receive a new one.</p>
  <br>


  <br>
  <h1>Assignees</h1>
  <br>


  <h4>How can I receive assignees?</h4>
  <p>After you sign up and agree to the Terms of Use, you need to make sure to select repositories in <a href="/settings">settings</a>.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>Can I get assignees for my organization repos?</h4>
  <p>Yes! Go to your <a href="/settings">settings</a> to select organizations. Your repositories will be updated.</p>
  <br>



  <h4>Can you guarantee my repos will get assignees?</h4>
  <p>Unfortunately we can't. You can create issues in GitHub to increase the likelihood of getting assignees.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>Can you guarantee a user will submit a pull request to my repository?</h4>
  <p>We can't guarantee that as well.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>How can I know who have received my repositories as their assignments?</h4>
  <p>You can see your assignees in <a href="/history">history</a> page.
  <br>


  <br>
  <h1>Account</h1>
  <br>


  <h4>Can I deactivate my account?</h4>
  <p>You can at <a href="/settings">settings</a> page. Note that a deactivated account will not receive further assignments or assignees.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>Can I delete my account?</h4>
  <p>You can at <a href="/settings">settings</a> page. We will immediately deactivate your account and schedule a deletion for 30 days. Note that a deactivated account will not receive further assignments or assignees.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>I deactivated my account, can I reactivate it?</h4>
  <p>Yes! When you login, we will take you to a reactivation page. You need to reactivate your account to continue using the site.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>I scheduled a deletion of my account, can I cancel it?</h4>
  <p>You can, but only if it hasn't been 30 days yet. When you login, we will take you to a reactivation page. Once you reactivate your account we will clear your scheduled deletion.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>I deleted my account. Can I bring my data back?</h4>
  <p>Unfortunately we can't bring back your deleted data. You can create an account from scratch by signing up.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>Some items in my history are missing. What happened?</h4>
  <p>We are sorry that happened. Users can request a deletion of their data, which can cause some items in your history to disappear.</p>
  <br>


  <br>
  <h1>More Questions</h1>
  <br>


  <h4>Can I sign up to receive both assignments and assignees at the same time?</h4>
  <p>Yes! We encourage you to do so.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>Can I get a notification when I receive an assignment/assignee?</h4>
  <p>Right now that is not possible, but we are working on it. For the time being, we recommend you to follow <a href="https://twitter.com/PullRequestClub" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">our Twitter account</a>.</p>
