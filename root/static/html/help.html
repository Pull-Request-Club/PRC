  <h4>What is a pull request?</h4>
  <p>Pull request is a way to contribute to open source projects. It contains a "diff", explaining modified files. On GitHub, it comes with a "discussion" so that contributors and maintainers can communicate. We recommend <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/" target="_blank">this article on GitHub</a> for more details.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>Wait, so how do I submit a pull request?</h4>
  <p>Take a look at <a href="https://github.com/CPAN-PRC/resources/wiki/My-first-Pull-Request" target="_blank">this wiki</a> that will walk you through your first pull request.</a></p>
  <br>


  <h4>What is Pull Request Club?</h4>
  <p>Pull Request Club (PRC) is an application where users can sign up with their GitHub accounts. It lets users receive assignments and/or assignees.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>Where did the idea of Pull Request Club came from?</h4>
  <p>We built Pull Request Club to be a successor of <a href='http://cpan-prc.org/' target='_blank'>The CPAN Pull Request Challenge</a>. We are grateful to Neil Bowers, who run CPAN-PRC for 4 years (January 2015 to December 2018).</p>
  <br>


  <h4>What is an assignment?</h4>
  <p>An assignment is a GitHub repository assigned to a user. User then submits a pull request to assignment repository.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>How can I receive assignments?</h4>
  <p>You need to update your <a href="/settings">assignment settings</a> to "ACTIVE: I want to receive assignments." You also need to read and agree to latest Terms of Use and Services, Privacy Policy and Cookie Law.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>When do I get assignments?</h4>
  <p>We send assignments out on 1st day of each month, 12 times a year.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>What is an open assignment?</h4>
  <p>An open assignment is an assignment that is neither completed nor cancelled. If you have an open assignment, we don't assign you more repositories.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>How do I complete an assignment?</h4>
  <p>You need to submit at least one pull request to your assignment repository on GitHub. Then you need to click "DONE" in <a href="/my-assignment">your assignment</a> page.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>What should go into the pull request?</h4>
  <p>It depends on what you want to work on, what author wants you to work on, and what open issues are there in repository. Feel free to get in touch with them to discuss ideas. You can add documentation, fix a test, implement new features etc.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>I need concrete pull request ideas!</h4>
  <p><a href="https://github.com/CPAN-PRC/resources/wiki/Pull-Request-Ideas" target="_blank">Here's some ideas</a>. Also see <a href="http://neilb.org/2015/04/27/increasing-merge-likelihood.html" target="_blank">this article about increasing merge likelihood</a>.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>Is there a PR etiquette I should follow?</h4>
  <p>Yes! We recommend you to take a look at <a href="http://neilb.org/2014/12/31/pr-etiquette.html" target="_blank">this post by Neil</a>.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>What happens if I don't complete my assignment?</h4>
  <p>It's ok! If you want to keep working on it, keep it open: don't "SKIP" it. If you want a new assignment instead, "SKIP" it before 1st of next month.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>How can I skip an assignment?</h4>
  <p>You need to click "SKIP" in <a href="/my-assignment">your assignment</a> page. You can keep receiving assignments even if you skip.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>How can I receive assignees?</h4>
  <p>You need to sign up with GitHub account, and update your <a href="/settings">assignment settings</a> to "ACTIVE: I want my selected repositories to be assigned." You also need to read and agree to latest Terms of Use and Services, Privacy Policy and Cookie Law. Lastly, you need to select repositories you want assigned at <a href="/my-repos">your repos</a> page.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>Can you guarantee my repos will get assignees?</h4>
  <p>Unfortunately no. You can create issues in GitHub to increase likelihood of getting assignees.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>Can you guarantee an user will submit a pull request to my repository?</h4>
  <p>That also we can't guarantee.</p>
  <br>


  <h4>Can I receive both assignment and assignees?</h4>
  <p>For sure! Please do.</p>
  <br>
