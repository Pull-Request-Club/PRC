# Contributing Guidelines

## Contact

Please get in touch with us even before starting to work on any issue.
Feel free to comment on any issues that you are interested in working on.
You may also create new issues to discuss with maintainers.

## Style

- Try to follow the same style in the codebase. It would help us a lot to make
the code readable and easier to maintain.
- We use 2 spaces to indent code.

## Git

- Rebase before merge (for linear history)
- Don't make unrelated changes in a commit. This includes whitespace changes.
If you want to make a whitespace change, please create another commit just for that.
- Please do not put "fixes" or "solves" in your commit message or PR text. This
will cause the referenced issue to close automatically.
